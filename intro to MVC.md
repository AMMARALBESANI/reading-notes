# What is MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern?

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern that separates an application into three components that communicate with each other: Model, View, and Controller. This separation makes the code easier to organize, maintain, and improve.

## What are the roles of MVC components?

1. **Controller**: The controller is the component that handles user requests and interactions. It acts as a bridge between the model and the view. The controller receives user inputs, performs the necessary actions, accesses the model to get or update data, and then chooses the right view to show the processed data to the user.

2. **Model**: The model is the component that represents the application's data and business logic. It is responsible for managing data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. The model component ensures that the data follows the rules and operations related to it, keeping the data consistent and valid. It does not depend on either the controller or the view.

3. **View**: The view is the component that displays data to the user. It creates a visual representation of the data obtained from the model. The view component does not interact with the model or the controller directly. Instead, it gets data from the controller and formats it for display.

## Key Points

- The model and the view do not interact with each other, promoting modularity and separation of concerns.
- The model does not handle request processing, response formatting, or database management. Its focus is on data-related tasks.
- The view only deals with presenting data and does not perform data manipulation or communicate with the model.
- The controller controls the flow of data between the model and the view. It interprets user inputs, triggers appropriate actions, and determines which view should display the results.

## What are Tag Helpers?

Tag Helpers are server-side components in ASP.NET Core that make it easier to render HTML elements in views. They provide a more concise and readable way to generate HTML compared to traditional HTML helpers. Tag Helpers encapsulate HTML rendering logic and are especially useful for integrating server-side code with HTML markup.

## What is Azure DevOps?

Azure DevOps, is a set of modern Microsoft services designed to help collaboration, planning, development, testing, delivery, and monitoring of software projects. Formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), Azure DevOps aims to close the gap between development and operations teams, fostering a more streamlined and efficient software development lifecycle.

**What are the services of Azure DevOps?**
1. **Boards**: Enables project planning, tracking, and collaboration using work items and boards.
2. **Repos**: Provides version control and source code management using Git repositories.
3. **Pipelines**: Allows you to create, test, and deploy continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
4. **Test Plans**: Supports test case management and manual/automated testing.
5. **Artifacts**: Helps manage and share package dependencies, such as NuGet packages, within your projects.

Azure DevOps services work together to enhance collaboration, automate processes, and deliver software more efficiently.
