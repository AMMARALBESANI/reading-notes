##  repository design pattern
It is a way of separating the data access logic from the business logic and the domain entities. It uses interfaces to communicate between these layers and to hide the details of the data source. It also connects factories, which create domain entities, with gateways, which handle persistence. The Repository pattern can be used with any kind of database and can be extended by creating classes for each repository. It is one of the most useful and widely applicable design patterns

## dependency injection
Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern that promotes loose coupling and separation of concerns in classes and their dependencies. It involves injecting dependencies into classes rather than instantiating them within the classes themselves.

In the context of ASP.NET Core, DI is extensively used to inject dependencies into various components, such as controllers, services, and middleware. The built-in IoC container in .NET Core simplifies this process by managing the creation and lifetime of objects.

By leveraging DI, developers can achieve better modularity, maintainability, and testability in their code. Additionally, the flexibility of ASP.NET Core allows for the replacement of the default IoC container with third-party containers that offer more advanced features if desired.

## repository pattern

The Repository pattern is a design pattern commonly used in Domain-Driven Design to separate the persistence concerns from the domain model. It involves defining one or more interfaces (abstractions) within the domain model to represent the operations needed to access data. These interfaces serve as contracts that define the available methods for data retrieval, storage, and manipulation.

The actual implementation of these interfaces, known as repository classes, is located outside the domain model. Repository classes encapsulate the logic required to interact with data sources, such as databases or external APIs. They provide a centralized and consistent way to perform common data access operations, abstracting away the details of the underlying infrastructure or technology.

By employing the Repository pattern, developers can achieve better maintainability, testability, and flexibility in their applications. The domain model remains decoupled from the specific data access mechanisms, allowing for easier swapping or updating of the underlying persistence technologies without affecting the core business logic.

##  SOLID principles
The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that aim to enhance the maintainability, flexibility, and understandability of software systems. Each principle focuses on a specific aspect of software design and promotes good practices for creating robust and extensible code.

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a class or module should have only one reason to change. It emphasizes that a class should have a single responsibility or purpose, making it easier to understand, maintain, and modify.

2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP): The OCP states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. It encourages developers to design their systems in a way that new functionality can be added through extension rather than modifying existing code. This promotes code reuse, maintainability, and minimizes the risk of introducing bugs.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): The LSP states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of their subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, derived classes should be able to substitute their base classes seamlessly, preserving the behavior and invariants of the base class. This principle ensures that the code relying on abstractions remains robust and doesn't break when using different implementations.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): The ISP emphasizes that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It suggests breaking down larger interfaces into smaller, more specific ones, tailored to the needs of individual clients. This prevents unnecessary dependencies and ensures that clients are not burdened with irrelevant functionality.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The DIP states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. It promotes the use of abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) to decouple modules and reduce direct dependencies. By relying on abstractions, changes in low-level modules do not affect high-level modules, fostering flexibility and enabling easier unit testing and mocking.

By adhering to these principles, developers can create software that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend. They promote modular, loosely coupled designs that are less prone to bugs and easier to adapt to changing requirements over time. Applying SOLID principles can lead to more robust and flexible software architectures.
