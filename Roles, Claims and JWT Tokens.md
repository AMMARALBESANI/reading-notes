**Roles in Application Access Control:**

In applications, roles are used to organize users based on their responsibilities or permissions. For instance, roles like "Admin," "User," and "Guest" categorize users into different access levels. Each role grants access to specific parts of the application and certain actions. This system helps manage who can access what and ensures that users can only use features they're authorized for.

**Claims-based Authorization in ASP.NET Core:**

Claims are like pieces of information that describe a user's identity or attributes. These could be things like their name, email, role, age, and more. Claims offer insights into a user's characteristics. They're especially useful in authentication and authorization processes, determining what actions a user can take within the application based on their attributes.

When an identity is established, it might be assigned claims issued by a trusted source. A claim consists of a name-value pair representing what the user is, rather than what they can do.

**Adding Claims Checks:**

Authorization checks based on claims:

- Are declarative, meaning they define access rules in a straightforward manner.
- Apply to Razor Pages, controllers, or specific actions within a controller.
- Cannot be applied at the Razor Page handler level; they must be used on the entire page.

**Distinguishing Authentication and Authorization:**

Authentication and authorization are two interrelated security aspects. Authentication is the process of confirming a user's identity, while authorization focuses on determining what actions a user is permitted to perform, essentially their permissions. Often, to grant authorization, you first need to authenticate the user.

**JWT Authentication:**

JSON Web Token (JWT) serves as a way to convey claims between parties securely. These claims are represented as a JSON object that's digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS) and/or encrypted using JSON Web Encryption (JWE).

JWT tokens are compact and self-contained, commonly used in ASP.NET Core MVC for authentication and authorization. They are digitally signed and contain user claims, such as their ID or roles. After logging in, users receive a JWT token they include in subsequent requests. Servers then validate the token's integrity, extract claims, and determine the user's identity and permissions.
