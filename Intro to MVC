# Introduction to MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern that divides an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. This division aims to simplify code organization, enhance maintainability, and improve overall efficiency.

## Components of MVC

1. **Controller**: The controller is responsible for managing user requests and interactions. It acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. The controller handles incoming requests, processes the required actions, interacts with the model to retrieve or modify data, and then selects the appropriate view to present the processed data to the user.

2. **Model**: The model represents the application's data and business logic. It is responsible for managing data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. The model component encapsulates the rules and operations related to data, ensuring that the data remains consistent and valid. It is independent of both the controller and the view.

3. **View**: The view is responsible for presenting data to the user. It generates the visual representation of the data obtained from the model. The view component is passive, meaning it does not directly interact with the model or the controller. Instead, it receives data from the controller and formats it for display.

## Key Points

- The model and the view are isolated from each other, promoting separation of concerns and modular development.
- The model does not deal with request handling, response formatting, or database management. Its focus is on data-related tasks.
- The view is concerned solely with presenting data and does not engage in data manipulation or direct communication with the model.
- The controller manages the flow of data between the model and the view. It interprets user inputs, triggers appropriate actions, and determines which view should display the results.

## Tag Helper

Tag Helpers are server-side components in ASP.NET Core that simplify the process of rendering HTML elements in views. They provide a more concise and readable way to generate HTML compared to traditional HTML helpers. Tag Helpers encapsulate HTML rendering logic and are particularly useful for integrating server-side code with HTML markup.

## Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps, short for Development and Operations, is a collection of modern Microsoft services designed to facilitate collaboration, planning, development, testing, delivery, and monitoring of software projects. Formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), Azure DevOps aims to bridge the gap between development and operations teams, fostering a more streamlined and efficient software development lifecycle.

**Components of Azure DevOps:**
1. **Boards**: Enables project planning, tracking, and collaboration using work items and boards.
2. **Repos**: Provides version control and source code management using Git repositories.
3. **Pipelines**: Allows you to create, test, and deploy continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
4. **Test Plans**: Supports test case management and manual/automated testing.
5. **Artifacts**: Helps manage and share package dependencies, such as NuGet packages, within your projects.

Azure DevOps services work together to enhance collaboration, automate processes, and deliver software more efficiently.
