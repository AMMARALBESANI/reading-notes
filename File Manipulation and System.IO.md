## File and Stream I/O
File and stream I/O in .NET provides functionality to read from and write to files, connections,
storage, networks, pipes. The System.IO namespace contains classes for working with files and pointers, 
including creating, copying, moving, and deleting. Streams represented by the Stream class and its derived classes can be read,
written, and searched in byte arrays. In addition, the reader and writer classes handle encoding and conversion of stream modes.
Asynchronous I/O functions are optimized for multitasking for improved performance responsiveness.
Classes are available in the System.IO.Compression namespace. Autosave provides a safe storage option,
especially when access to user files is restricted. When working with I/O, it is important to consider security and access control requirements.

## How to: Write text to a file
there are various methods and classes such as StreamWriter, File, and Method. 
The StreamWriter class allows synchronous and asynchronous writing, while the File class provides static methods for writing and appending text to a file.
Path class helps in converting file paths. This article includes examples of each method and shows how to write and append text using StreamWriter,
write text using StreamWriter, and write and append text using the File class.
It is important to note that the examples given are very limited and do not include mismanagement and unusual activity.

## How to: Read and write to a newly created data file
This is a step-by-step guide to reading and writing newly created data files in .NET using the BinaryWriter and BinaryReader classes. 
And mention the importance of FileMode.Create and FileMode.CreateNew to prevent exceptions when creating new files.
When using FileMode.Create, if the file already exists, it will be overwritten with an empty file. This means that if the file exists,
it will be replaced without throwing an exception. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.
On the other hand, FileMode.CreateNew is more restrictive. If the file already exists, it will throw an IOException, indicating that the file already exists and cannot be created again. This prevents accidentally overwriting existing files.
The process involves creating an empty file stream, using a BinaryWriter to write a series of integers to the file,
and then using a BinaryReader to read and print integers from the file.
