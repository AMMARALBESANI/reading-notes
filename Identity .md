## Identity in ASP.NET Core 
refers to the framework's integrated authentication and authorisation system. It makes it simple for developers to set up user authentication, govern user accounts, and apply access control to various application components. The ASP.NET Core Identity package, a component of the ASP.NET Core framework, serves as the foundation for the identity system.

## Key features of ASP.NET Core Identity include:

User Authentication: ASP.NET Core Identity allows you to authenticate users using various methods such as username/password, external login providers (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.), or other authentication schemes like OAuth and OpenID Connect.

User Management: It provides functionality to manage user accounts, including features like user registration, password recovery, and account confirmation via email.

Role-based Authorization: ASP.NET Core Identity supports role-based authorization, which means you can assign roles to users and control access to specific parts of your application based on those roles.

Claims-based Authorization: It also supports claims-based authorization, where you can define specific claims for users and grant access based on these claims.

Integration with Entity Framework Core: ASP.NET Core Identity integrates seamlessly with Entity Framework Core to store user information and settings in a database.

Cookie Authentication: By default, ASP.NET Core Identity uses cookie authentication to manage user sessions, allowing users to stay authenticated between requests.

## To use ASP.NET Core Identity in your application:

Install the necessary packages: In your ASP.NET Core project, install Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity package using NuGet.

Configure Services: In the ConfigureServices method of Startup.cs, add Identity services using AddIdentity method and configure the authentication options.

Configure Middleware: In the Configure method of Startup.cs, use the UseAuthentication and UseAuthorization middleware to enable authentication and authorization in the application pipeline.

Create User and Role Models: Define your user and role models that inherit from IdentityUser and IdentityRole, respectively. You can also extend these models to include additional properties as needed.

Seed Initial Data (Optional): If you want to prepopulate the database with initial roles or users, you can create a database seeder method.

Secure Your Controllers and Actions: Use [Authorize] attribute on controllers or actions that need authentication and, if necessary, use [Authorize(Roles = "RoleName")] to restrict access to specific roles.
