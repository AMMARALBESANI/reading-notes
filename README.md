## DATA BASE and SQL
![My score](./assist/2023-06-10%20(3).png)

Relational databases use tables to organize and store data, while SQL provides a standardized language for managing that data. Key concepts include tables with rows and columns, primary keys for unique identification, relationships between tables, joins to combine data from multiple tables, DML for data manipulation, DDL for defining and modifying the database structure, constraints to enforce data integrity, and indexes for improved query performance. Relational databases and SQL offer a powerful solution for managing structured data in various domains.

## Command Line 
The command line, also known as the terminal, is a text-based interface that enables users to interact with a computer system through commands. Here are the main points:

- The command line provides a prompt where users can enter commands and view the output.
- Terminals can be accessed through the Terminal application on macOS, System/Utilities on Linux, or SSH clients like PuTTY on Windows.
- The shell, such as Bash, interprets and executes the commands.
- Utilizing shortcuts enhances productivity and efficiency within the command line.

# commands for basic navigation
1. `pwd` displays the current working directory.
2. `ls` lists the contents of a directory.
3. Paths can be absolute (starting from the root directory) or relative (relative to the current directory).
4. `cd` changes the current directory.

# Commands for file manipulation:
1. `mkdir` creates a new directory.
2. `rmdir` removes an empty directory.
3. `touch` creates a new file or updates access/modification times.
4. `cp` copies files or directories.
5. `mv` moves or renames files or directories.
6. `rm` removes files or directories.

# Important file concepts:
1. Linux treats everything as a file and doesn't rely on file extensions for determining file types.
2. Linux distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters in file and directory names.
3. Spaces in names can be managed by using quotes or escape characters.
4. Hidden files and directories start with a dot (.) and can be shown using the `-a` option with `ls`.

# Using man pages:
1. Man pages provide detailed information about commands.
2. Access man pages by entering `man` followed by the command name.
3. Man pages consist of sections such as name, synopsis, description, and command line options.
4. To exit man pages, use the `q` key.
5. Searching within man pages can be done using the `-k` option for global search or `/` for searching within a page.
