Relational databases use tables to organize and store data, while SQL provides a standardized language for managing that data. Key concepts include tables with rows and columns, primary keys for unique identification, relationships between tables, joins to combine data from multiple tables, DML for data manipulation, DDL for defining and modifying the database structure, constraints to enforce data integrity, and indexes for improved query performance. Relational databases and SQL offer a powerful solution for managing structured data in various domains.
