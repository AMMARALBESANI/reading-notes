## Inheritance
is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows classes to inherit properties and behavior from other classes,
creating class hierarchies.
## Abstraction
is the principle of hiding unnecessary details and revealing the essential characteristics of an object or system, 
thereby providing a simplified view or interface for interacting with complex functionality.
## Polymorphism
allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, increasing code flexibility, extensibility, and modularity.
This OOP principles include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, modularity, encapsulation, and composition. 
These principles aim to improve code structure, readability, reusability, and maintainability in object-oriented programming.
