# React

**Description**:
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook. It is used for building user interfaces (UIs) for web applications. React uses a component-based architecture, which means you can create reusable UI elements called components. React efficiently updates the UI when data changes, thanks to its virtual DOM (Document Object Model) reconciliation algorithm.

# React - Hello World

**Description**:
This is the simplest React example, typically used as a starting point for learning React. It involves creating a React component that renders a basic "Hello, World!" message to the web page.

# React - JSX

**Description**:
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript commonly used with React. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files, making it easier to describe the structure of your UI components.

# React - Rendering Elements

**Description**:
Rendering elements in React is the process of converting React elements (which are plain JavaScript objects) into actual DOM elements that can be displayed in the browser. React uses a virtual DOM to optimize this process and minimize DOM manipulation.

# React - Components & Props

**Description**:
React components are reusable building blocks that encapsulate a piece of the user interface. Props are a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component. Props allow you to customize and configure components dynamically.

# React - State & Lifecycle

**Description**:
State in React represents data that can change over time. Components can have their own state, and changes in state trigger re-rendering. Lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` allow you to perform actions at different stages of a component's existence.

# React - Handling Events

**Description**:
In React, you can attach event handlers to elements to respond to user interactions, such as clicking a button or submitting a form. React event handlers are written in a similar way to standard HTML event handlers.

# Tailwind CSS

**Description**:
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed utility classes for styling HTML elements. Instead of writing custom CSS, you compose styles by applying classes directly to your HTML elements. This approach promotes consistency and speeds up development.

# Utility First CSS

**Description**:
Utility-first CSS is a CSS methodology where you create small, reusable utility classes for specific CSS properties like margins, padding, text colors, and more. You compose these utility classes to style your components and maintain a consistent design system.

# Next.js

**Description**:
Next.js is a React framework for building web applications. It simplifies common tasks like server-side rendering (SSR), routing, code splitting, and deployment. It offers a great developer experience and helps optimize performance and SEO for web apps.
