## Authentication, authorization, and cookies are fundamental concepts in web security and user management. They play crucial roles in ensuring the security and proper functioning of web applications. Let's explore each of these concepts in more detail:

1. **Authentication:**
   Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity attempting to access a web application. It ensures that the user is who they claim to be. Common methods of authentication include:
   - **Username and Password**: Users provide a unique username and a secret password that they have previously registered with the system.
   - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: This adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification, such as something they know (password) and something they have (a mobile device).
   - **Biometric Authentication**: This includes methods like fingerprint or facial recognition.
   - **OAuth and OpenID Connect**: These are authentication protocols that allow users to log in using their existing accounts from other platforms (e.g., logging into a website using your Google or Facebook account).

2. **Authorization:**
   Authorization is the process of determining what actions or resources a user is allowed to access or perform within a web application after they have been authenticated. Authorization is often based on roles, permissions, and access control lists (ACLs). For example, a user with the "admin" role might have more privileges than a regular user. Authorization ensures that authenticated users only have access to the parts of the application they are allowed to use.

3. **Cookies:**
   Cookies are small pieces of data that a web server sends to a user's web browser, and the browser stores this data locally. Cookies are often used to maintain stateful information across multiple HTTP requests. They are commonly used for:
   - **Session Management**: Storing a session ID in a cookie so the server can identify the user across requests and maintain their session state.
   - **Authentication**: After a user logs in, a cookie can be used to store an authentication token that is sent with each subsequent request to prove the user's identity without requiring them to re-enter their credentials.
   - **Tracking User Preferences**: Storing user-specific settings or preferences.
   - **Shopping Carts**: In e-commerce, cookies can store items in a user's shopping cart.
