# Razor Pages

**Razor Pages** is a web development framework introduced by Microsoft as part of ASP.NET Core. It is designed to simplify the creation of dynamic web pages and applications by providing a clean and efficient way to build web UIs with server-side code. Razor Pages is an alternative to the more traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in ASP.NET Core.

## Key Aspects

1. **Page-Oriented Development**: Razor Pages are organized around individual web pages. Each page typically consists of two parts: a `.cshtml` file that defines the HTML markup and Razor syntax for rendering content, and a corresponding `.cshtml.cs` file that contains the C# code to handle HTTP requests, perform data operations, and manage page events.

2. **Convention-Based Routing**: Razor Pages use convention-based routing, which means that the URL structure of your application is closely tied to the folder structure and naming of your Razor Page files. This can make it easier to understand the routing logic in your application.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: Razor Pages promote a more natural separation of concerns, where code related to a specific page is contained within that page's `.cshtml.cs` file. This can make it easier to maintain and understand the codebase, especially for smaller to medium-sized applications.

4. **Razor Syntax**: Razor Pages use Razor syntax, which is a combination of HTML markup and C# code. This allows developers to embed C# code directly into the HTML, making it easy to generate dynamic content and interact with data from the server.

5. **Built-In Dependency Injection**: ASP.NET Core's built-in dependency injection container is readily available in Razor Pages, making it easy to inject services and components into your page classes.

6. **Lifecycle Events**: Razor Pages provide lifecycle events such as `OnGet`, `OnPost`, and others, which allow you to handle HTTP GET and POST requests and perform tasks before and after these requests.

7. **Model Binding**: Model binding is a powerful feature in Razor Pages that simplifies the process of extracting data from incoming requests and mapping it to C# objects.

8. **Tag Helpers**: Razor Pages support tag helpers, which are C#-based HTML helpers that make it easier to generate HTML elements and attributes in a type-safe way.

9. **Partial Pages**: You can use partial pages in Razor Pages to encapsulate and reuse sections of your UI across multiple pages.

10. **Authentication and Authorization**: Razor Pages can easily integrate with ASP.NET Core's authentication and authorization features to secure your application.

Razor Pages is a good choice for building web applications that primarily focus on delivering server-rendered pages with minimal client-side interactivity. It provides a simpler and more focused approach compared to ASP.NET Core MVC, making it suitable for projects where you want to maximize developer productivity and maintainability. However, for complex single-page applications (SPAs) with heavy client-side functionality, ASP.NET Core MVC or client-side frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.js may be more appropriate.
