Interfaces are contractual agreements that separate code usage from implementation, allowing code to interact with different 
implementations without having to deal with each implementation explicitly. Sonmez emphasizes building interfaces only when needed, 
following YAGNI principles, reducing dependencies, and splitting classes for maintainability. Interfaces can be static, static abstract,
or virtual and inherit from other interfaces. Following this principle helps to make the codebase lighter and easier to maintain. 
The C# reference article provides a high-level overview of interfaces, covering topics such as default members, static abstract and virtual members, inheritance,
and explicit implementation syntax.
